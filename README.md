  <h1>Introduction</h1> 
The tool that I have chosen to conduct a critical review and carry out further research into for this assignment is the programming software Python.  The reasons as to why I have chosen Python, is because of its flexibility and how it enables tasks associated with DH research, while addressing the challenges posed by its technical complexity and learning curve. 
The study of Python in a critical sense allows students or researchers in general to question who is empowered or excluded by Python-based methods, how technical expertise shapes academic authorities and how it actively shapes human knowledge and expertise. In addition, Python is often praised for its ability to not just analyse text but reshape how it can be understood and studied upon even further. It is not just a tool, but a method of practice worthy of scholarly critique. 
In this assignment, I will examine Python’s core strengths and limitations in comparison with other DH tools, along with how its suitability for humanities students and researchers, and how to consider how programming-based methods can shape research questions, methodologies and interpretive outcomes with the digital humanities module. 

 <h1>Context and Background </h1>
Python is an open-source programming language that was first developed by Guido van Rossum in the late 1980’s and was released publicly in February 1991 at the National Research Institute for Mathematics and Computer Science in the Netherlands.   Python is derived from many languages, including C++, ABC, and other scripting languages. Van Rossum wanted Python to be a high-level language that was powerful yet easy to read and use. The word “Python” is related to a species of snake. Rossum also gained the idea of the name Python from a popular comedy series “Monty Python’s Flying Circus”. 

Today, Python is commonly used for tasks such as text mining, data cleaning, stat analysis and data visualization, making it a versatile tool rather than a single-purpose platform. Python’s journey took a turn when machine learning and artificial intelligence started to take off. For example, TensorFlow quickly became a favourite in the deep learning community because of its ability to build and train large-scale neutral networks. PyTorch provides greater flexibility and is easy to use, specifically for researching and prototype creation. It comes with various tools that make tasks like for example, regression, classification, and clustering more manageable.   
According to Statisa, Python was the most in-demand programming skill job posting in 2024. What makes it stand out is its easy learning style, for young school students and coding boot camps, and is considered an introductory language into the world of coding. Another key factor that makes Python stand out is its versatility, depending on what form of web development you are considering making – Python has all the tools and libraries to help you. Thirdly, is Python’s very own community, being one of its most noteworthy advantages.  Being that the language is open source which tells that developers worldwide are part of its growth.

 <h2> Tool Exploration </h2> 
Python was accessed through my own personal laptop, using the standard Python distribution software. This setup allowed me to have an integrated workflow combining code execution, documentation, and visual output on a single interface. Unlike many other web-based DH tools that require user registration or server development, Python can be installed instantly, giving students and researchers full control over their work environment and databases. 
In relation to usability, Python presents a mixed experience for humanities researchers, as the language is often praised for its readable syntax, which limits the barrier to entry compared to other programming software. The learning curve remains significant for users without any prior coding experience. With tools such as Jupyter Notebook, it makes it that bit more accessible, that can support exploratory analysis and annotation. 
Python possesses Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), which is an important step in data analysis which focuses on understanding patterns, trends and relationships through statistical tools and visualizations. Python offers various libraries such as pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn and plotly which enables effective exploration and insights generation to help in further modelling and analysis.  
What makes Python so popular and unique is its flexibility and extensibility, as it enables researchers to design analytical workflows that are tailored to specific research questions, such as data visualization or network analysis. However, this flexibility does have a limit; tasks that can be easily completed in DH platforms often require an elongated setup time and scripting also. In addition, the results are highly dependent on the researcher’s methodological choices, which can create bias or reduce critical thinking if is not carefully documented. 
Overall, Python is released under an open-source license, that values the DH collaboration and values its openness. However, there are ethical concerns that remain around the data selection, representation or algorithmic interpretation, highlighting the need for more critical research when applying computer methods into Digital Humanities research. 

  <h3> Comparative Analysis </h3> 
Python has become one of the most used programming languages in Digital Humanities, for text-based research. Unlike visual, point-and-click tools, Python requires users to write code, this means that each step of the analysis is explicit, making the research process easier to explain, critique, and repeat.  meaning that each step of the analysis is explicit, making the research process easier to understand, critique and explain.  For this reason, Python is often valued for its transparency and reliability in academic research. 
In comparison to Ruby, Python offers a wider range of tools for language and text analysis. Ruby is frequently used for DH projects, focusing on building digital websites and collected works, such as Omeka. While Ruby code is praised for its readability and structure, it has very limited libraries to store large-scale text analytics. As a result for this, Ruby is commonly used for managing data workflows or connecting analysis for online publication rather than for statistical analysis of texts. 
JavaScript plays a different role altogether within DH research. It is used to create interactive and engaging visualisations, such as maps, graphs or timelines. In many DH projects, JavaScript is applied after any key analysis has been created in Python. JavaScript is excellent for presenting research findings and engage with wider audiences, it is less effective for processing large texts datasets or performing analytical tasks on its own. 
Overall., Python occupies a key position between both JavaScript and Ruby. As it has become more powerful than Ruby for analysing large text collections and more suitable than JavaScript for handling complex computer-based tasks. At the same time, Python works well alongside both languages: Ruby can support publishing and project infrastructure, while JavaScript can enhance the presentation and interpretation of results. In accordance with researchers, who want a flexible, well-supported and transparent method for text analysis, Python is the most practical core tool within the Digital Humanities workflow.

 <h4> Reflection and Recommendations <h4/>   
In relation to my own research workflow, Python fits it due to its flexibility, wide usage and easy way of learning. Personally, it helps me to work with large text datasets, how to analyse data and create complex visualizations in a single compartment. Along with tools such as Spyder and Jupyter Notebooks, they make it possible to document each part of the research process, which also supports experimenting and presenting results. Especially in Digital Humanities research, where interpretation and practice often coincide very well together. 
When compared to Ruby and JavaScript, Python feels more practical for research-focused assignments. JavaScript is very effective for creating interactive, internet-based projects; however, it is less suited to large-scale text analysis and often requires more technical setup. For Ruby, it has a sophisticated syntax and is strong in web development but has a smaller ecosystem of Digital Humanities libraries and a smaller research community. 
In my opinion, I would highly recommend Python to other humanities students or researchers, particularly those who are interested in text analysis or data-driven methods. Its readability and wide range of resources that make it accessible to beginners while remaining in power for advanced studies. However, Python can be improved upon by offering more beginner-friendly interfaces and clearer learning essentials, particularly made for Digital Humanities. 
Overall, the research conducted using Python is ultimately verifiable and reproducible. Code, Data and other analytic steps can be shared openly, allowing researchers to replicate results and evaluate findings, which strengthens the reliability of Digital Humanities research. 

<h4> Conclusion <h4/> 
                          
In conclusion, this assignment has demonstrated that Python is a highly essential tool within the Digital Humanities research due to its flexibility, transparency and analytical capabilities. Through comparing Python with Ruby and JavaScript, Python arose as the most suitable core tool for large-scale text analysis and reproducible research practices. While it presents a learning curve, its expansive libraries, strong community support, and adaptable functionality make it very effective for DH students and researchers. Using Python has reinforced the importance of methodological awareness, documentation, and critical engagement with digital tools, which highlights how computer-based methods actively reshape and actively transform knowledge production within the Digital Humanities module. 

“Python is often praised for its ability to not just analyse text but reshape how it can be understood and studied upon even further. It is not just a tool, but a method of practice worthy of scholarly critique “(Jockers, 2013; Underwood, 2019).
